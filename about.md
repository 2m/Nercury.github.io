I am a javascript developer currently living and working in Vilnius, Lithuania.

Previously I was programming in PHP, Python, C++, C#, F#, Java, UnrealScript, Delphi and even Visual Basic 6.
I love investigating new promising technologies, and my current passion is Rust.

If you find some stupid enough English mistake in this blog, you can [fix
it with a pull request](https://github.com), and for that I would be extremely thankful.
