I am a software engineer living in Vilnius, Lithuania.

Currently I am hacking javascript, Backbone or node.js.

Previously I was coding in PHP, Python, C++, C#, F#, Java, UnrealScript, Delphi and even Visual Basic 6.
I love investigating new promising technologies, and my current passion is Rust.

If you find some stupid enough English mistake in this blog, you can [fix
it with a pull request](https://github.com/Nercury/Nercury.github.io/tree/master/_posts),
and for that I would be extremely grateful.
